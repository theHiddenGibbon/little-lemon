            <p>Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant.</p>
            <p>To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.</p>
            <p>The restaurant is open every day from 8am to 11pm. <Link to="/reservations" className="about-link reserve">Reservation</Link> is recommended for lunch and evening meals.</p>
